When I got down to the lot, not only were there no cars in the Gold lot, there were no cars in any section of the lot! The employee made no mention of this! We stood there wondering what to do and searched around the parking garage for an employee but it was a ghost town with no one there readily available to assist customers. Eventually, another customer who was waiting for a vehicle told us that we would have to hurry and grab any car we saw pull in because there were not enough cars for the amount of people waiting. Cars were arriving so infrequently that customers were sprinting with their luggage to the vehicles in order to get to the car first. My husband and I stood there waiting for half an hour until a Toyota Corolla was dropped off which we were forced to take because we were in a time crunch. So not only did we have to wait outside in the 100 degree Phoenix heat with all of our luggage for a half an hour, but we were not even able to receive the Class C car that we had made a reservation and paid for.

I've always been very pleased with every aspect of Hertz Gold Member service. However, on my latest rental receipt, I saw on my bill that I was charged for satellite radio at $4.99 per day. As a Gold Member, I pick any car in the Gold area. I don't know whether it has satellite radio or not, especially since most vehicles have a satellite radio button. How am I supposed to know if it's active? Sadly, this seems a little scammy to me. Put a car on the Gold lot, have a Gold member select it, hope the member doesn't look at their receipt, and voila, an extra $4.99 a day to the profit center. Personally, I have satellite radio on all my cars. And, I know most vehicle manufacturers offer the option free for the first 1 to 2 years of ownership, depending on the manufacturer. In reviewing the Hertz website, it is clearly stated that Sirius radio is an extra cost. However, for Gold Members who pick any car on the Gold lot and don't know whether a car has the option, please don't charge us. OR, put a BIG sign in the window stating: 'This vehicle includes satellite radio - choosing this vehicle will result in an additional $4.99 per day fee."

However, access to roadside assistance and help starting a claim when my rental was involved in a traffic incident was terribly delayed. I could not speak to live person for 2-3 days. Had I truly needed a tow or further assistance on the roadside, I would have waited far too long on hold. Of all the places to focus customer service resources, this is the area that counts the most. My experience trying to get a hold of someone nearly makes it impossible for me to recommend Hertz despite how well everything else went."

It looked good. I went to the airport to pick up and there were no SUVs on the lot. I was told to either wait until my car comes in or take one of the other cars on the lot (there were maybe 3 of them). I waited a bit then gave up and took a truck... The really annoying thing was looking at the receipt after I returned the car: I was charged $33 over what I agreed to pay. It seems they rented me the truck at the same rate as the SUV that I actually wanted, as they very well should, but they didn't discount the myriad attendant fees. So I was charged an extra $20 for the loss/damage waiver, an extra few dollars here and there. I spent an hour talking to a customer service rep on the phone (most of it was wait time). I was told I'd get at least some of the $33 removed in 5-7 days. We'll see. It was an exhausting, exasperating experience. The only reason I give this 1 star is that I suspect other rental companies are even worse."

Two individuals were working the counter and while I do not know the complexity of the reservations they were handling, I waited for 30 minutes before a third individual arrived at the counter and helped me. It took this individual less than 5 minutes to locate our vehicle and direct me accordingly. I have used Hertz many times in the past, and this experience was the most negative. This time, making a reservation ahead of time did not help at all when it came time to pick the vehicle up. I so still enjoy the fact that once I pick up the vehicle, I simply drive to the exit and my contract is printed there with no complications. I also enjoy the return procedures and the ease with which vehicles are returned. The counter is what made this experience less than excellent."

I called Hertz roadside assistance to arrange for a new car. I was put on hold. Hertz roadside assistance came back on and informed me that because no one at the Phoenix Airport Hertz location would answer the phone, she could not arrange for replacement car and I would need to ride in the tow truck back to the Phoenix Hertz and arrange for a replacement myself. I reluctantly agreed because I was not given any other choice. The Roadside assistance person started talking about a double tow without explaining what that means. While waiting for the tow truck to arrive. I attempted several times to call the Phoenix airport Hertz office, but was unable. I call another business at the airport that had a direct number to Hertz and called that. I was told that Hertz would not be able to deliver a replacement car to me because a tow truck was already dispatched. I found this unacceptable as I was not in a hurry and could wait. But was again told that it was not possible. After requesting a manager, I was offered to have a replacement sent to my hotel later that evening and after the original car was returned by the towing company. I walked from the restaurant back to my hotel to wait. (this is in the Phoenix area. It was 107 degrees) A replacement car was delivered a few hours later. After checking my cell phone logs, I added up the time I spent on the phone with Hertz-trying to get someone to answer, talking to a representative, or on hold - 67 minutes. 67 minutes to get Hertz to agree to send a replacement for one of your cars that broke down it POOR customer service. I my current job, I rent cars often and make the choice of companies myself. I will definitely be considering choices other than Hertz."

I was very pleased with being able to choose among a number of different vehicles within the class. The only difficulty was with the shuttle returning to the airport after dropping off the car. I assumed that all shuttles would stop at each terminal. However, the shuttle bypassed Terminal 3 (the terminal I needed) and went straight on to Terminal 4. My Wife and I had to take the skytrain to get to Terminal 3. Fortunately, we had more than sufficient time to make our flight, but the added effort of moving our luggage up and down escalators etc. was a bit burdensome. RECOMMENDATION: Provide better identification/signs for which shuttles go to which terminal(s). Other than the minor shuttle experience, I was very pleased with my car rental experience with Hertz."
